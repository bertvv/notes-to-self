In this post, we take this one step further and show how you can run multi-platform tests of Ansible roles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Testing Ansible roles with Travis-CI, Part 1: CentOS</title><link>https://bertvv.github.io/notes-to-self/2015/12/11/testing-ansible-roles-with-travis-ci-part-1-centos/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2015 20:49:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://bertvv.github.io/notes-to-self/2015/12/11/testing-ansible-roles-with-travis-ci-part-1-centos/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this first post on testing Ansible roles with Travis-CI, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how you can apply a test playbook on CentOS. Out-of-the-box, Travis-CI doesn&amp;rsquo;t support CentOS, as its test environment is Ubuntu-based. However, Travis-CI allows you to set up a Docker container and this opens up all kinds of possibilities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automating `mysql_secure_installation`</title><link>https://bertvv.github.io/notes-to-self/2015/11/16/automating-mysql_secure_installation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2015 16:07:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://bertvv.github.io/notes-to-self/2015/11/16/automating-mysql_secure_installation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Many HOWTO&amp;rsquo;s and blog posts about installing MySQL/MariaDB, a LAMP stack, etc. suggest to run the script &lt;code>mysql_secure_installation&lt;/code> to tighten the security holes in the default installation of the database engine. This includes setting a root password (empty by default), removing anonymous users, and deleting a test database. For a database server that you&amp;rsquo;re going to run in production, it is really important to do this. However, I have a problem with the fact that &lt;code>mysql_secure_installation&lt;/code> is interactive, i.e. it asks for user input. This makes it very hard to include it in an automated setup. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how the script works and how we can automate what it does.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Installing VirtualBox Guest Additions in Fedora 22</title><link>https://bertvv.github.io/notes-to-self/2015/10/08/installing-virtualbox-guest-additions-in-fedora-22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2015 19:06:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bertvv.github.io/notes-to-self/2015/10/08/installing-virtualbox-guest-additions-in-fedora-22/</guid><description>&lt;p>VirtualBox Guest additions are a set of drivers that you can install on virtual machines to enable a few cool features: a scaling desktop in the VM, shared clipboard, shared folders, etc. This post discusses how to install these in Fedora 22.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VirtualBox Networking: an overview</title><link>https://bertvv.github.io/notes-to-self/2015/09/29/virtualbox-networking-an-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2015 20:58:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bertvv.github.io/notes-to-self/2015/09/29/virtualbox-networking-an-overview/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the greatest pitfalls when working with VirtualBox VMs is a good understanding of how networking works. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the most important differences between them, and their limitations when you use VirtualBox to experiment with setting up network services on a VM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our system administration courses, we use VirtualBox to allow students to set up their own Linux machines without having to resort to dual booting. VirtualBox is certainly not the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; virtualization platform, but it is supported on the three common desktop platforms and works similarly on all of them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
