Hi! My name is Bert Van Vreckem and I'm a lecturer at [Ghent University of Applied Sciences (HOGENT)](https://hogent.be/). I mainly teach Linux system administration and introductory data science.

In this blog, I write about stuff that I learn, about solutions for problems that I encounter, answer great questions from my students (or from you!), etc. Topics include basic Linux system administration, shell scripting, configuration management with Ansible, etc.

I can offer workshops and talks (in Dutch or English) about the subjects below. Contact me if you're interested.

- Ansible
- Git and Github
- LaTeX
- Linux system administration
- Vagrant
- Vim
