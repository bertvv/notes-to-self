# Notes to self

This repository contains the source code of my blog, hosted on <https://bertvv.github.io/notes-to-self>. If you want me to write about a specific subject within the topics covered (Linux, CentOS, Ansible, LaTeX, ...), [open an issue](https://github.com/bertvv/notes-to-self/issues)!

## Setup

The `public/` directory contains the generated site, as it is published on Github Pages. It is set up as a [`git-worktree(1)`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) for the `gh-pages` branch.

The `themes/` directory contains the site theme as a Git submodule.

The other directories are the Hugo "source code" of the site.

## Cheat sheet

Useful commands

### Workflow

```ShellSession

$ vi content/post/some-title.md

```

**Publish on Github Pages**

Run script `./publish.sh`, which does the following:

- Test whether `hugo server` is running (it should not!)
- Generate the site with command `hugo`
- Push changes in `gh-pages` to Github
